# Background
tsinsen is an online automatic judger system, used mainly for infomation science basic training.
See the official website [http://www.tsinsen.com/](http://www.tsinsen.com/) for more detail.

# Motivation
By using tsinsen system I found the following problems:

* tsinsen system does not support browsers other than IE very well, for example, the copyToClipboard (of code) functionality can only be used with IE browser
* new version of tsinsen system has not been implemented with full functionality
* it is inconvenient to find history submit records for users.

Therefore, I try to build a light-weighted client to submit codes, browser history submits and so on.

# How to build
Python v3.x
pip install requests

# To-Do-List
More test

# Some Explanation
This git repo also contains the course problems I attend in 2013. The professor uses tsinsen system for assignments. All problems have been downloads in directory "history_questions".
