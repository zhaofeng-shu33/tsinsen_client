<h1 id="motivation">Motivation</h1>
<p>By using tsinsen system I found the following problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>tsinsen system does not support browsers other than IE very well, for example, the copyToClipboard (of code) functionality can only be used with IE browser</li>
<li>new version of tsinsen system has not been implemented with full functionality</li>
<li>it is inconvenient to find history submit records for users.</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, I try to build a light-weighted client to submit codes, browser history submits and so on.</p>
